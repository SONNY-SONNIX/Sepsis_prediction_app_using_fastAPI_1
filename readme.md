Access the App: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:7860. You'll be greeted with a welcome message!

Prediction Endpoint 🔮
Use the /predict/ endpoint to predict sepsis for a patient. Send a POST request with the following input parameters:

Plasma glucose
Blood Work Result-1 (mu U/ml)
Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
Blood Work Result-2 (mm)
Blood Work Result-3 (mu U/ml)
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Blood Work Result-4 (mu U/ml)
Patient's age (years)
Conclusion and Next Steps 🏁
This FastAPI application demonstrates how to predict sepsis using a machine learning model. Dockerization makes deployment hassle-free. Feel free to customize and extend the app for your own projects!
